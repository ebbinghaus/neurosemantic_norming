                    You have been invited to take part in a research study to learn more about how people represent everyday concepts. This research is being supervised by Dr. Todd Gureckis, Department of Psychology, New York University. <strong>Participation in this study is limited to individuals between the ages of 18-40 years old who are native English speakers with no history of neurological or psychiatric condition and who are not currently taking psychoactive medication(s).</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to do the following:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>View visual stimuli (words) on a computer screen;</li>
                        <li>Listen to auditory stimuli (spoken words)</li>
                        <li>Make judgments about stimuli</li>
                        <li>Answer some general demographic questions about your expertise and background (optional)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Participation in this study will involve approximately 30-120 minutes of your time. <strong>The study is of minimal risk - no greater than normally encountered using a standard office computer.</strong> Although you will receive no direct benefits beyond familiarity with how psychology research is conducted, this research may help the investigator understanding how people represent everyday knowledge. You will receive $7/hour for your time (prorated), with the potential for a $1-$2 bonus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the you are otherwise entitled. If you withdraw you will be compensated for the time devoted to the study and your data will be discarded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. We assign code numbers to each participant so that data is never directly linked to individual identity. Data are kept in our laboratory and are only viewed by the investigators. Computer files are kept indefinitely. If the results are published, the information remains anonymous and disguised so that no identification can be made. This research is supported by the U.S. Government and the DoD may inspect these records for auditing purposes.
